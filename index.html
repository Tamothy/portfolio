        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>I became curious in programming after noticing my kids at work using their smartphones to send messages. During my childhood we would send messages by writing them on paper, folding them up, and then secretly passing them in class without getting caught. Nevertheless, I thought it was interesting to see a new generation of kids sending messages through a programming medium. It's really awesome that programming has changed our ways of communicating, and I want to be a part of that, but sometimes I do miss the <span class="classy">classy</span> way of writing messages on paper.</p>
